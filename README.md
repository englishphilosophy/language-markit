# Markit language support for Atom and VSCode

This package provides language support for
[Markit](https://github.com/englishphilosophy/markit) in both Atom and Visual
Studio Code. If you are using Atom, you may also like the
[atom-markup-helper](https://atom.io/packages/atom-markup-helper), which
provides some useful keyboard shortcuts for working with Markit (as well as HTML
and Markdown).
